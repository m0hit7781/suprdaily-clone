                We understand that you trust us to deliver the groceries you need, and we are trying our best to ensure that your daily needs are at your doorstep every morning. Due to an increase in demand, we will continue our deliveries till 9 am so that we can cater to all our customers in these trying times.</p>
                <p>All our staff - whether it's delivery partners or warehouse employees, follow mandatory hygiene routines that have been implemented before and during deliveries.</p>
